# Point in Polygon

The project illustrates the [algorithm described by W. Randolph Franklin](https://wrf.ecse.rpi.edu/Research/Short_Notes/pnpoly.html)

## Getting Started

[PointInPolygonJAR.zip](https://github.com/drewbul/PointInPolygonMaven/raw/master/PointInPolygonJAR.zip) - download and unpack this archive to some folder on your computer and you can run the game by starting start.bat (for Windows) or start.sh (for Linux).

## Prerequisites

The project was developed using Java SE 8 and Java FX, so you will need the respective Java Runtime Engine. It is possible you already have it installed since Java can be used for many other programs. If not, you can install it from here:

You can run this program under Windows, Linux and MacOS. You can record your voice and replace the WAV files. You can also replace MP3 files and edit the input parameter in the start.bat file, but the appropriate codecs must be installed in your operating system (in Ubuntu 18, by default they were missing).
